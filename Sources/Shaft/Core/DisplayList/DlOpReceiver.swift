    /// have the given `paint`'s [Paint.colorFilter] and [Paint.blendMode]
    /// applied.
    ///
    /// This lets you create composite effects, for example making a group of
    /// drawing commands semi-transparent. Without using [saveLayer], each part of
    /// the group would be painted individually, so where they overlap would be
    /// darker than where they do not. By using [saveLayer] to group them
    /// together, they can be drawn with an opaque color at first, and then the
    /// entire group can be made transparent using the [saveLayer]'s paint.
    ///
    /// Call [restore] to pop the save stack and apply the paint to the group.
    ///
    /// ## Using saveLayer with clips
    ///
    /// When a rectangular clip operation (from [clipRect]) is not axis-aligned
    /// with the raster buffer, or when the clip operation is not rectilinear
    /// (e.g. because it is a rounded rectangle clip created by [clipRRect] or an
    /// arbitrarily complicated path clip created by [clipPath]), the edge of the
    /// clip needs to be anti-aliased.
    ///
    /// If two draw calls overlap at the edge of such a clipped region, without
    /// using [saveLayer], the first drawing will be anti-aliased with the
    /// background first, and then the second will be anti-aliased with the result
    /// of blending the first drawing and the background. On the other hand, if
    /// [saveLayer] is used immediately after establishing the clip, the second
    /// drawing will cover the first in the layer, and thus the second alone will
    /// be anti-aliased with the background when the layer is clipped and
    /// composited (when [restore] is called).
    ///
    /// ## Performance considerations
    ///
    /// Generally speaking, [saveLayer] is relatively expensive.
    ///
    /// There are a several different hardware architectures for GPUs (graphics
    /// processing units, the hardware that handles graphics), but most of them
    /// involve batching commands and reordering them for performance. When layers
    /// are used, they cause the rendering pipeline to have to switch render
    /// target (from one layer to another). Render target switches can flush the
    /// GPU's command buffer, which typically means that optimizations that one
    /// could get with larger batching are lost. Render target switches also
    /// generate a lot of memory churn because the GPU needs to copy out the
    /// current frame buffer contents from the part of memory that's optimized for
    /// writing, and then needs to copy it back in once the previous render target
    /// (layer) is restored.
